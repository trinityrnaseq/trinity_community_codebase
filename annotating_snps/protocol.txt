# This pipeline is designed to:
# 1. Call SNPs in a pooled transcriptome
# 2. Genotype (efficiently) the same SNPs in each sample (3 in this case: 229, 230, 231)
# 3. Annotate the SNPs for effects such as synonymous/missense, etc.
# 4. Merge genotypes, SNP annotations, and gene annotations from a trinotate report

# Prepare pooled (3) samples for HaplotypeCaller:
sbatch variantcallingALL.sh

# Call HaplotypeCaller on pooled (3) samples...
# Also make sure the output includes only biallelic SNPs:
sbatch variantcallingALL_part2.sh

# Prepare Sample 229 for HaplotypeCaller:
sbatch variantcalling229.sh

# Call HaplotypeCaller on Sample 229:
sbatch variantcalling229_part2.sh

# Prepare Sample 230 for HaplotypeCaller:
sbatch variantcalling230.sh

# Call HaplotypeCaller on Sample 230:
sbatch variantcalling230_part2.sh

# Prepare Sample 231 for HaplotypeCaller:
sbatch variantcalling231.sh

# Call HaplotypeCaller on Sample 231:
sbatch variantcalling231_part2.sh

# Create fasta of concatenated REF snps from pooled output (use VCF file)
# Call this concat.fa
# Create table of desired SNPs from pooled output (use VCF file)
# Columns should be CHROM, POS, NEW, REF
# Call this SNPlist_concat.txt

# Change names of samples in Samples 229, 230, 231 VCF files
sbatch changeVCFnames.sh

# Run joint genotyping pipeline create here...
# This sidesteps the ENORMOUSLY inefficient pipeline CombineGVCFs | GenotypeGVCFs
# With 100,000s contigs, estimated waiting times are 10-60 years!
# The pipeline in GATK 4 of GenomicsDBImport | GenotypeGVCFs is much faster...
# Unfortunately right now it only accepts one interval (contig)
# This pipeline below will use the SNPs identified in the pooled VCF...
# And create a single (fake) interval from them, then run GenomicsDBImport | GenotypeGVCFs
# Afterwards it will return the intervals to their original identities
# It will make sure the output only includes biallelic SNPs
sbatch genotypecalling_fast.sh

# Now do some final editing: make sure REF/ALT for SNPs agree between pooled and individual genotypes:
# e.g., Run this in Rstudio
final.editing.R

# Next run TransDecoder to get GFF3 of CDS:
sbatch Transdecoder_supertranscripts.sh

# Finally, run VEP. I suggest using table output
sbatch vep_tableoutput.sh

# If you have a trinotate report in *.txt format (use NA instead of . for missing values)...
# You can run this script in Rstudio to combine genotypes, SNP annotations, and gene annotations
# You might need to edit a few things to match your files:
JoinGenotypesAndSnpAnnotations.R
